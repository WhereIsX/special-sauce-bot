### need a database(sqlite) for these
choose duck-sona (Aylesbury Duck) -> animate these! in duck pond(js)
when duckies use our emotes, we give them points?!
!feed all 
!feed < duck name >
    - how we give duckies points 

### need a NLP for these
SEMANTIC ANALYSIS!?

make another program, "What Would ____ Do?"
which is just bunch of commands => response
and it compiles this to a file.json
