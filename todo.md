0. hashmap to methods 
0.5 say hi to new duckies! 
1. captured regexp groups
2. make a "PONG" for their PING ;)
    - when twitch PINGs, do we have to PONG?
        i.e., if we respond and say something random into channel (instead of PONG),
        do we get dc?
3. respond to @ us 
4. NLP SEMANTIC ANALYSIS!


thoughts for bot features
when duckies use our emotes, we give them points?

make another program, "What Would ____ Do?"
which is just bunch of commands => response
and it compiles this to a file.json
that Charlie can reference?

Charlie will eventually get a database (sqlite db that will be just files! :>)
