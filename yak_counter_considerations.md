# GOAL: to count the number of yak we shave every stream  
    - secondary goal: keep track of the # of yaks shaved so that we can analyze :D
    - !yak = 0 
    - !yak++

# HOW? 
    - use a table bc sometimes we take down the bot




# analyze! 
    - how many yaks do we shave per hour? => 
        - how many hours was that stream? 
        - how many yaks were shaved? 
        - yaks_shaved / hours_stream 
    - do we shave more yaks at night or during the day? 
        - when did the stream start? 
    - do we shave more yaks during the weekend?
